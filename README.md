<h1> Park-NET: identifying Urban parks using multi source spatial data and Geo-AI </h1>

This is a master thesis project done by Marta Kozłowska and Jiawei Zhao for ‘Applied Data Science programme at Utrecht University. We have a similar goal of building a model (based on CNN) that identifies urban parks using spatial data, but different approaches and research questions.

This project is still in progress.
